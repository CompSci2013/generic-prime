# Session Status

- **Branch**: main
- **Last Commit**: d96926b - docs: Session 60 summary - Component split & autocomplete complete
- **Status**: Session 60 complete. Component split (BasicResultsTableComponent, QueryPanelComponent) done. Autocomplete filter type implemented.
- **Next Task**: IMMEDIATE ACTION 1: Query Panel UX Refinement (from NEXT-STEPS.md).
- **Reality Check**: Working tree is clean. `PROJECT-STATUS.md` indicates Autocomplete was implemented in Session 60 (Commit `4bb7123`), which supersedes the last dialog entry where it was being discussed. The current goal is UX *refinement* of this existing feature.
- **Dialog Status**: Last recorded dialog ended with UX discussion, but project docs confirm implementation was completed subsequently.
