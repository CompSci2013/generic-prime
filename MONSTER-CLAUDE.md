Status: Version 5.66 - Bug #14 PERMANENTLY FIXED & DEBUGGED. ResourceManagementService lifecycle issue resolved.
Next Task: IdP Phase 1: Deploy Keycloak Infrastructure (Postgres + Keycloak in K3s platform namespace).
Reality Check:
- NEXT-STEPS.md is outdated (mentions Session 57 as current, but Session 58 is complete).
- Working tree is clean.
- Git log shows Session 58 commits are present.
- MONSTER-LOG.md is missing Session 58 details (ends at Session 57).
- Identity Strategy documented in docs/infrastructure/idp/IDENTITY-STRATEGY.md.
