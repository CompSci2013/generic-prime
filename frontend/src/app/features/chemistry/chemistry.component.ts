/**
 * Chemistry Domain Landing Component
 *
 * Serves as the landing page and navigation hub for the Chemistry domain within the Generic Discovery Framework.
 * This component provides an overview of chemistry data discovery capabilities and guides users to the discovery interface.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Implements the domain landing page pattern used across Agriculture, Chemistry, Math, and Physics domains
 * - Provides feature descriptions for molecular composition, reaction data, element properties, and chemical analytics
 * - Includes a call-to-action section directing users to the discovery interface
 * - Displays dataset information and quick tips for users getting started with chemistry data exploration
 *
 * @architecture
 * **Purpose**: Domain-specific landing page for chemistry data exploration
 * **Pattern**: Feature showcase with CTA (Call-To-Action)
 * **Navigation Flow**:
 *   - User arrives from domain selector (/home) → ChemistryComponent
 *   - Clicks "Launch Discovery Interface" → Routes to /chemistry/discover
 *   - Can view test reports or return to domain selection
 *
 * @template
 * The component uses a multi-section layout:
 * 1. **Header Section**: Domain title, icon, and subtitle
 * 2. **Features Grid**: Four feature cards describing chemistry capabilities
 *    - Molecular Composition: Structure and formula analysis
 *    - Reaction Data: Chemical reaction mechanisms and conditions
 *    - Element Properties: Periodic table and element characteristics
 *    - Chemical Analytics: Property visualization and analysis
 * 3. **CTA Section**: Call-to-action buttons for discovery interface and test reports
 * 4. **Info Section**: Dataset information and quick tips cards
 * 5. **Back Link**: Navigation back to domain selector
 *
 * @styling
 * - Dark theme with cyan accents (#64c8ff, #4ba3d9)
 * - Gradient backgrounds with transparent overlays
 * - Smooth animations: fadeInDown, fadeInUp, pulse effects
 * - Responsive grid layout with auto-fit columns (minmax 240px-1200px)
 * - Responsive breakpoint: 768px for mobile adjustments
 * - Hover states: Card elevation, icon scaling, color transitions
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <!-- Usage in routing -->
 * <router-outlet></router-outlet>
 *
 * <!-- Renders the full chemistry landing page with navigation -->
 * ```

 * - {@link AutomobileComponent} - Similar landing page for automobile domain
 * - {@link PhysicsComponent} - Similar landing page for physics domain
 * - {@link DiscoverComponent} - Discovery interface (target of navigation)
 * - {@link HomeComponent} - Domain selector (source of navigation)
 *
 * @lifecycle
 * - **Constructor**: No initialization needed; component is stateless
 * - **ngOnInit**: Not required; no lifecycle hooks needed
 * - **No Input/Output**: Completely self-contained landing page
 *
 * @dataset-info
 * **Chemistry Data Characteristics**:
 * - Supports: Organic and inorganic compounds
 * - Data points: Molecular properties and reactions
 * - Scope: Academic and industrial chemistry
 * - Discovery capability: Search by molecular formula or compound name
 * - Filter capability: By chemical properties and characteristics
 * - Analysis capability: Reaction mechanisms and kinetics visualization
 *
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 1.0.0 (Added as part of multi-domain framework expansion)
