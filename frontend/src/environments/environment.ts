/**
 * Development Environment Configuration
 *
 * @fileoverview
 * Environment configuration for development builds. This file defines runtime settings
 * for the application during development with ng serve or development server.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Build-Time Replacement**:
 * This file is replaced during production builds via the `fileReplacements` array in angular.json.
 * The build process automatically uses environment.prod.ts instead when building with
 * --configuration production flag.
 *
 * **Configuration Details**:
 * - `production`: false - Development mode enabled for debugging
 * - `apiBaseUrl`: Development backend endpoint via Kubernetes Traefik ingress
 * - `includeTestIds`: true - Enables test-id attributes for E2E Playwright tests
 *
 * **Backend Access**:
 * The API endpoint (http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1) uses Traefik ingress
 * on the Kubernetes control plane (Loki), allowing access from:
 * - Thor SSH shell
 * - Development container via `--network host`
 * - E2E test container (with /etc/hosts entry)
 * - Windows client (with /etc/hosts pointing to 192.168.0.110)
 *
 * **Test Attribute Behavior**:
 * When includeTestIds is true, Angular components can use [attr.data-testid] attributes
 * for E2E test selectors. These attributes are stripped in production builds to reduce HTML output.
 *
 * @see environment.prod.ts - Production environment configuration
 * @see angular.json - Build configuration with fileReplacements array
 * @see ORIENTATION.md - Infrastructure and network configuration
 *
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 1.0.0

   * URL pattern: http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1
   * - Hostname: generic-prime.minilab (resolves to Loki 192.168.0.110 via /etc/hosts)
   * - Port: 80 (standard HTTP, routed through Traefik ingress)
   * - Path: /api/specs/v1 (API route prefix for data discovery service)
   *
   * This endpoint is available in:
   * - Development container (--network host enables access to cluster hostnames)
   * - Thor SSH shell (direct access to cluster internal networking)
   * - E2E test container (with /etc/hosts entry for generic-prime.minilab → 192.168.0.110)
   * - Windows client (with /etc/hosts entry for generic-prime.minilab → 192.168.0.110)
   *
   * The same endpoint works for both development server (port 4205) and production deployments
   * because all requests route through the Kubernetes Traefik ingress controller on Loki.

   * E2E test attribute flag
   *
   * When true, Angular components can use [attr.data-testid] for test selectors.

   * <button [attr.data-testid]="'manufacturer-filter-button'">
   *   Filter by Manufacturer
   * </button>

   *
   * Playwright selectors can then target these attributes:
