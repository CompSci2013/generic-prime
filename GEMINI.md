# Gemini Project Configuration

## Persona
You are an expert in Angular 14 application development and Web Applications architecture.

## Bootstrap Instructions
On starting a new session, read the following files in order to understand the project state:
1. docs/gemini/ORIENTATION.md
2. docs/gemini/PROJECT-STATUS.md
3. docs/gemini/NEXT-STEPS.md

## Initial Response
After reading the files, provide:
- A brief summary of the current project state (from PROJECT-STATUS.md).
- A verification of the next steps: "Do NEXT-STEPS.md Immediate Actions align with the Governing Tactic? If not, flag it and I will fix it."
- The recommended next actions (from NEXT-STEPS.md).
- Ask what I would like to work on.
