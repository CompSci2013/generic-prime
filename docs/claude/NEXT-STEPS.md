# Next Steps

**Current Session**: Extend E2E test coverage to Phases 6-9 (optional/lower priority)

---

## Immediate Action: E2E Test Suite Complete

**Status**: ✅ All 33 tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Completed in Session 8**:
- ✅ Refactored 10 failing tests using URL-first approach
- ✅ Achieved 100% pass rate (33/33 tests)
- ✅ Improved execution time: 39.5 seconds (down from 51.6s with failures)
- ✅ Established URL-first testing pattern for stable test automation

## Optional: Expand E2E Coverage to Phases 6-9

**Priority**: Low (Nice-to-have, not blocking)

**What to Do** (if pursuing):

1. **Phase 6: Panel Pop-Out Windows**
   - Tests pop-out/undock panel behavior
   - Challenge: Playwright multi-window handling requires special setup
   - Recommendation: Manual testing for now (complex automation overhead)

2. **Phase 7: Edge Cases & Browser History**
   - Tests browser back/forward button behavior
   - Tests history state management with filters
   - Requires: Specialized Playwright history navigation patterns

3. **Phase 8: Keyboard Navigation & Accessibility**
   - Tests keyboard-only navigation paths
   - Tests focus management and ARIA attributes
   - Requires: Playwright accessibility assertions

4. **Phase 9: Performance & Data Handling**
   - Tests behavior with large result sets
   - Tests pagination with various page sizes
   - Tests filter combination performance

**Recommendation**:
- Phases 1-5 provide solid core functionality coverage
- Phases 6-9 have diminishing returns for automation effort
- Continue with manual spot-checks for these areas per MANUAL-TEST-PLAN.md
- Revisit if specific bugs emerge in these areas
