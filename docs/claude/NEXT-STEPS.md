# Next Steps

**Current Session**: Session 31 - Pop-Out Panel Styling Refinement Complete

---

## SESSION 30 COMPLETED: Achieved 100% JSDoc Documentation Coverage

**Status**: ✅ Completed. Enhanced automobile statistics model classes, achieved 100% Compodoc coverage.

### What Was Done
- ✅ Analyzed Compodoc coverage report (started at 98%)
- ✅ Identified remaining low-coverage items in automobile.statistics.ts
- ✅ Discovered most files were already well-documented (PhysicsSyllabusComponent, ReportComponent, AutomobileApiAdapter, PanelPopoutComponent all had 70%+ coverage)
- ✅ Enhanced VehicleStatistics with 14 properties individually documented
- ✅ Enhanced ManufacturerStat with 5 properties + static factory method
- ✅ Enhanced ModelStat with 5 properties + utility method (getFullName)
- ✅ Enhanced BodyClassStat with 4 properties + static factory method
- ✅ Enhanced YearStat with 4 properties + 2 utility methods (isCurrentYear, getAge)
- ✅ Added 50+ new JSDoc comments across all model classes (246 lines total)
- ✅ Committed changes: "docs: Enhance automobile statistics model documentation for 100% Compodoc coverage"
- ✅ Updated PROJECT-STATUS.md with Session 30 final achievement
- ✅ Verified 100% coverage achieved

**Key Achievement**:
- Coverage progression: 88% → 97% (Session 28) → 98% (Session 29) → **100% (Session 30)** ✅
- Total JSDoc comments added across Sessions 28-30: **200+ individual comments**
- Files enhanced: **30+ TypeScript files**
- Consistent documentation pattern now applied across entire codebase

## SESSION 31 COMPLETED: Pop-Out Panel Styling Refinement

**Status**: ✅ Completed. Fixed styling issues on pop-out windows.

### What Was Done
- ✅ Removed "Automobile Discovery" subtitle from panel popout headers (freed up vertical space)
- ✅ Changed popout header text color to white for better visibility
- ✅ Changed "Clear All" button from danger (pink) to secondary (gray)
- ✅ Changed multiselect filter dialog "Apply" button from danger to primary
- ✅ Changed year range filter dialog "Apply" button from danger to primary
- ✅ Verified all other pop-out components (Statistics, Results Table, Picker) have consistent styling
- ✅ Updated PROJECT-STATUS.md with Session 31 achievements

**Key Improvements**:
- Pop-out windows now have cleaner headers with white text on dark background
- All button colors align with dark theme (lara-dark-blue) instead of mismatched pink
- Consistent styling across all panel types

## SESSION 32 PLAN: Pop-Out Window Manual Testing

**Status**: Ready to perform comprehensive pop-out functionality testing.

### Immediate Next Actions

**1. Manual Testing Protocol** (1-2 hours)
   Follow the 10 test scenarios documented in the pop-out architecture:
   - [ ] Test 1: Open pop-out on Model Picker
   - [ ] Test 2: Verify state sync from main → pop-out
   - [ ] Test 3: Verify state sync from pop-out → main
   - [ ] Test 4: Verify multiple pop-outs work independently
   - [ ] Test 5: Verify filter operations propagate correctly
   - [ ] Test 6: Verify pop-out closes cleanly
   - [ ] Test 7: Verify page refresh closes all pop-outs
   - [ ] Test 8: Multi-monitor scenario (if available)
   - [ ] Test 9: Network latency simulation with DevTools throttling
   - [ ] Test 10: Console validation - verify message flow

**2. Testing Checklist**
   - Open Developer Console to monitor BroadcastChannel messages
   - Open multiple pop-out windows simultaneously
   - Test filter changes in main window (should propagate to pop-outs)
   - Test filter changes in pop-out (should propagate to main)
   - Close pop-out windows and verify state cleanup
   - Refresh page and verify all pop-outs close automatically

**3. Document Results**
   - Note any issues found during testing
   - If bugs discovered, add to PROJECT-STATUS.md Known Bugs section
   - Create reproduction steps for any failing tests

**4. Next Priority After Testing**
   - Fix Bug #13: PrimeNG dropdown keyboard navigation in Query Control
   - Fix Bug #7: p-multiSelect visual state issue

## SESSION 31+ PLAN: Physics Knowledge Graphs (After 100% Coverage)

**Priority**: HIGH (Extends Physics domain educational value)

### What to Do

Implement knowledge graphs for remaining Physics course tiles following the Classical Mechanics pattern:

**1. Electromagnetism Knowledge Graph** (2-3 hours)
   - Create: `frontend/src/app/features/physics/electromagnetism-graph.ts`
   - Create: `ElectromagnetismGraphComponent` wrapper
   - Add route: `/physics/electromagnetism-graph`
   - Topics: Electric Fields, Magnetic Fields, Maxwell's Equations, Wave Propagation, Radiation, etc.

**2. Thermodynamics Knowledge Graph** (2-3 hours)
   - Create: `frontend/src/app/features/physics/thermodynamics-graph.ts`
   - Create: `ThermodynamicsGraphComponent` wrapper
   - Add route: `/physics/thermodynamics-graph`
   - Topics: Temperature, Energy, Entropy, Laws of Thermodynamics, Phase Transitions, etc.

**3. Quantum Mechanics Knowledge Graph** (2-3 hours)
   - Create: `frontend/src/app/features/physics/quantum-mechanics-graph.ts`
   - Create: `QuantumMechanicsGraphComponent` wrapper
   - Add route: `/physics/quantum-mechanics-graph`
   - Topics: Wave Functions, Schrödinger Equation, Uncertainty, Spin, Angular Momentum, etc.

**Implementation Steps** (for each subject):
1. Define 15-20 topic nodes with appropriate levels and colors
2. Map 20-30 edges showing prerequisites and relationships
3. Create wrapper component using generic KnowledgeGraphComponent
4. Add route to app-routing.module.ts
5. Add component declaration to app.module.ts
6. Update physics-concept-graph.component.ts navigateToNodeGraph() to map node clicks
7. Build and test visualization

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Navigate from concept-graph node → knowledge graph displays
- [ ] Zoom/pan controls work smoothly
- [ ] Click nodes → info panel shows correctly
- [ ] Hover edges → tooltips appear
- [ ] Fit-to-View button resets visualization
- [ ] Back button returns to physics page

## After Knowledge Graphs: Pop-Out Window Manual Testing

**Priority**: HIGH (Validates architecture stability)

**What to Do**: Follow the 10 test scenarios in POPOUT-ARCHITECTURE.md
1. Open pop-out window on Model Picker
2. Verify state sync from main window to pop-out
3. Verify state sync from pop-out to main window
4. Verify multiple pop-outs work independently
5. Verify filter operations propagate correctly
6. Verify pop-out window closes cleanly
7. Verify page refresh closes all pop-outs
8. Multi-monitor scenario (if available)
9. Network latency simulation with DevTools throttling
10. Console validation - verify message flow

## After Pop-Out Testing: Fix Known Bugs

**Priority**: MEDIUM (User Experience)

### Bug #13: PrimeNG Dropdown Keyboard Navigation
**Component**: p-dropdown with `[filter]="true"` in Query Control (Manufacturer filter)
**Issue**: Keyboard navigation broken - arrow keys don't highlight, Enter/Space don't select
**Workaround**: Mouse click works fine

**Fix Steps**:
1. Inspect component in browser DevTools for missing tabindex/accessibility attributes
2. Test if issue is PrimeNG bug or configuration conflict
3. Check if `[editable]="true"` + `[filter]="true"` combination causes issue
4. Implement onKeyDown event handler as workaround if needed
5. Verify with other filters (Body Class, etc.)

### Bug #7: Multiselect Visual State
**Component**: p-multiSelect (Body Class filter)
**Issue**: Checkboxes remain checked visually after clearing filters (filtering works correctly)
